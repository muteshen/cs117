To run the backend server, one must have installed the google cloud SDK as well as running in python 2.7. Navigate to ./protected-u and run:

dev_appserver.py app.yaml

The server should be hosted on port 8080 of localhost, or otherwise specify. 

The working version of the server can be found at:
http://protected-u.appspot.com
All the works mentioned in the report are all in main.py. All other files are suppliments and do not need to look into them.




To run the frontend app, extract two .rar files and open with Android studio. Then export to an Android phone with developer mode enabled.
